# Some explanations:

# header lines: all optional:
# label: type of partition table. dos (MBR) is the old an widely supported one, gpt the new shiny thing.
# unit: only sectors is supported. 1 sector usually equals 512 bytes. Find with cat /sys/block/sda/queue/hw_sector_size See also: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/2668/finding-the-sector-size-of-a-partition
# device: informative only I think
# partition lines:
# start: offset inside the disk at which the partition starts.

# start has very good defaults, and can often be ommited:

# on the first line, start is 2048, i.e. 1Mb (2048 + 512), which is a sane default for disk compatibility
# further start default to the first unallocated position
# size: man sfdisk says: The default value of size indicates "as much as possible". So to fill the disk with a single partition use: /dev/sda : start=2048, type=83

# type: See https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/sfdisk.8.html and for GUID https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUID_Partition_Table
