https://onstep.groups.io/g/main/wiki/26586#AXIS1  --> AXIS1_LIMIT_MIN et MAX et pareil pour AXIS2

AXIS1_LIMIT_MIN

    Default Value: -180
    Other Values: -90 to -270 or -360 (degrees)
    Notes: Minimum Hour Angle for Equatorial Mount modes (to -270 degrees) or minimum Azimuth for AltAzm mode (to -360 degrees.)
    Reminder:
        To disable limits in Azimuth (unlimited range) set to -360 and also set AXIS1_LIMIT_MAX to 360.
        During tracking and gotos if a limit is broken motion is stopped by canceling any goto and turning tracking off.  Keep in mind that up to SLEW_RAPID_STOP_DIST (Config.h) distance should be allowed for to stop the motors/mount once the limit is detected. 

LIMIT_SENSE

    Default Value: OFF
    Other Values: OFF, ON, ON_PULLUP, ON_PULLDOWN
    Notes: Limit sense switches can be wired so several can be used where any switch change causes OnStep to stop tracking and slews (allowing for SLEW_RAPID_STOP_DIST.)  This is most often implemented as a panic switch the user can press and/or lever switches on the mount axes.
    Associated Options:
        LIMIT_SENSE_STATE
            Default Value: LOW
            Other Values: LOW, HIGH
            Notes:
                Use LOW for NO (normally open) switches.  If multiple switches of this type are used wired them in parallel.
                Use HIGH for NC (normally closed) switches.  If multiple switches of this type are used wired them in series.
    Reminder: For my recent PCB designs this input DOES have a pullup resistor along with a bypass capacitor to provide basic ESD protection.
