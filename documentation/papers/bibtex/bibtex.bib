  ABSTRACT={TIGRE (Telescopio Internacional de Guanajuato Robótico Espectroscópico) has been operating in fully robotic mode in the La Luz Observatory (Guanajuato, Mexico) since the end of 2013. With its sole instrument, HEROS, an échelle spectrograph with a spectral resolution R ∼20,000, TIGRE has collected more than 48,000 spectra of 1,151 different sources with a total exposure time of more than 11,000 h in these 8 years. Here we briefly describe the system and the upgrades performed during the last years. We present the statistics of the weather conditions at the La Luz Observatory, emphasizing the characteristics that affect the astronomical observations. We evaluate the performance and efficiency of TIGRE, both optical and operational, and describe the improvements of the system implemented to optimize the telescope’s performance and meet the requirements of the astronomer in terms of timing constraints for the observations and the quality of the spectra. We describe the actions taken to slow down the optical efficiency loss due to the aging of the optical surfaces as well as the upgrades of the scheduler and the observing procedures to minimize the time lost due to interrupted observations or observations that do not reach the required quality. Finally, we highlight a few of the main scientific results obtained with TIGRE data.}

  AUTHOR={Sun, Jian and Cheng, Hao-Wen and Jiang, Hai and Liu, Jing and Zhao, Yuan-Yuan},
  TITLE={A 36 cm robotic optical telescope: Equipment and software},
  JOURNAL={Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences},
  VOLUME={9},
  YEAR={2022},
  URL={https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.897065},
  DOI={10.3389/fspas.2022.897065},
  ISSN={2296-987X},
  ABSTRACT={The paper describes an optical telescope system and control software for robotic observation of space debris. The telescope has a main aperture of 355 mm, adopts the optical design scheme of primary focus with a large field of view, and is equipped with a highly sensitive 4 K sCMOS camera to achieve a large field of view of 2.6° × 2.6°. The telescope is equipped with an environmental monitoring system and a highly reliable dome to ensure the safe operation of the telescope. The control software of the telescope consists of two parts. One part is deployed locally to comprehensively schedule the robotic operation of various equipment of the telescope system, and the other part is deployed remotely to realize the functions of equipment status monitoring, networking scheduling, remote control, and data management. At present, four telescopes have been deployed in Korla, Xinjiang, China to form a telescope array, basically realizing the remote “unattended” observation of space debris.}
